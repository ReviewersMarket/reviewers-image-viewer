# Reviewers Image Viewer

## Getting Started
### Install

To get started, simply install the module via NPM:

```bash
npm install reviewers-image-viewer
```

### Usage
Once the library has been installed, import the CSS file within your React app's `index.js` file. You'll also need to import the function to initialize.

```jsx
import {initReviewersImageView} from 'reviewers-image-viewer'
import 'reviewers-image-viewer/dist/index.css'
```

```js
  useEffect(() => {
        initReviewersImageView("");
  }, []);
```

The two plan types are `individual` and `team`.

Navigate to the React component where you wish to insert a lightbox, and import the component required:
```jsx
import {Slideshow} from 'reviewers-image-viewer'
```

Next, wrap the images in the `Slideshow` component:
```jsx
<Slideshow className="container grid grid-cols-3 gap-2 mx-auto">
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/pAKCx4y2H6Q/1400x1200" />
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/AYS2sSAMyhc/1400x1200" />  
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/Kk8mEQAoIpI/1600x1200" />
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/HF3X2TWv1-w/1600x1200" />
</Slideshow> 
```

### Next.js Guide
To get started with Next.js, be sure to take a look at, which shows how to set-up Lightbox.js and create an image gallery that opens the lightbox when an image is clicked on.

import React, { Component } from 'react'

    return 
          <Slideshow>
